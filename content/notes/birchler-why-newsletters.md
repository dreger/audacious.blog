Matt Birchler: 

> [...] you don’t see nearly as many new blogs these days, and things like Substack and Mailchimp have made it so that anyone can get up and running with a newsletter, and if they’re big enough, get paid to do so.



First, I don't have an email newsletter. Yet. I may never have one. There's a link to a Google Form somewhere on this site if you're interested in that sort of medium. 

But to Mr. Birchler's above quote. 

That sums it up nicely, I think. If you want to write, and you want those words to turn into money, then you're going to take the shortest road between those two points. 

Substack does this well. 

And let's talk about the inbox. Why are email newsletters great? Because everyone has an inbox. Will it lead to newsletter fatigue? Absolutely, but we're already trained on how to handle emails that annoy us: delete them. 

Getting into someone's inbox is too good to pass up. After signing up, you don't have to do anything else to be notified of new writings. Also, how great is not worrying about another login?



But to Mr. Birchler's question.
