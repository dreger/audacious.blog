summary: Josh Ginter is too talented.

For years I've been recycling an anecdote about a man who desperately wanted to be a professional photographer for Major League Baseball. But he wasn't a professional photographer, and he didn't have any ins with MLB. What he did have, however, was a front-row seat to his child's weekend tee-ball games. 

So this guy decides you know what, I love taking photos, and I'm going to photograph this tee-ball team as though they were the freaking New York Yankees. He spent the whole season, every game, camera in hand, snapping the most striking photos of 5-year-olds struggling to swing a bat you've ever seen. 

The anecdote, as I heard it, wraps up with this man's local newspaper picking up and running a few of his photos. And then, eventually, an actual MLB team gives him the call to shoot one of their games. 

I have no idea if this story is true. But what reminds me of the tale today is reading through Joshua Ginter's "first impressions" of the iPhone 12 Pro over on *The Sweet Setup*. 

(I put "first impressions" in quotes because what credibility Mr. Ginter loses for misunderstanding what "impressions" means he makes up for by the time you finish his 3,400 word treatise.)

This is not only a good *review* of the iPhone 12 Pro, but also some of the best product photography of Apple's newest phone I've seen anywhere. Save for maybe Apple themselves.

Anyhow, what I'm trying to say is you should read the review. It's a treat, and the photos are a delight. Once again, Mr. Ginter has hit it out of the park.
