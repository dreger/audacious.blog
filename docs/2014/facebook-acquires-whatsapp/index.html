  	<p>Interesting choice of words from WhatsApp founder Jan Koum <a href="http://blog.whatsapp.com/index.php/2014/03/setting-the-record-straight/">on the company&rsquo;s blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn&rsquo;t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change.

<p>I&rsquo;d love to believe this is true, but given the price tag, I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; is right. You were acquired. Even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10101272463589561">Zuckerberg says so</a>.</p>
