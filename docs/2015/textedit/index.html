  	<p>Can we take a moment to thank the folks at Apple for TextEdit? I’m serious. There is no shortage of text editors for OS X, yet I find myself continually coming back to TextEdit. It’s fast, simple, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/TextEdit/Introduction/Intro.html">open source</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and every Mac has a copy preinstalled.

<p>Apple’s OS X apps tend get a lot of criticism, but after 10 years and tens of thousands of words, I have yet to have a major issue with TextEdit. For getting thoughts to screen, it just works, and I think that deserves some public praise.</p>
