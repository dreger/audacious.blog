  	<p>Last one for the night. Hayden Dingman, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3030271/software/firewatch-review-lots-of-smoke-but-no-spark.html">covering the game for PCWorld</a>:</p>

<p><em>Firewatch</em> is beautiful. <em>Firewatch</em> is intriguing. But ultimately I don&rsquo;t think <em>Firewatch</em> is very good. At its best, this is a quiet game about two characters struggling with real-life insecurities. But when that&rsquo;s sidelined to make room for a main plot, <em>Firewatch</em> suffers. It&rsquo;s a game perfect for trailers, a game full of excellent dialogue and breathtaking moments and stunning vistas that ultimately amounts to nothing much at all.</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/firewatch/critic-reviews">Metacritic</a> and <a href="http://opencritic.com/game/2129/firewatch">OpenCritic</a>, sites that aggregate reviews, peg <em>Firewatch</em> at 82/100. I don&rsquo;t expect <em>Firewatch</em> to set the world on fire, but I feel it&rsquo;s going to be one of those games that raises the bar. Knockout graphics, great voice acting. Expect to hear about this one for the next couple of weeks.</p>
