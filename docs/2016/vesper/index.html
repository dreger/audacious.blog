  	<p>Speaking of apps that are going away, next up is Vesper, an iOS note taking app from Q Branch. Reading through the release notes, it seems Q Branch itself — comprised of well-known writer John Gruber, developer Brent Simmons, and designer Dave Wiskus — will also be shutting down within the next month.</p>
<p>I stopped using Vesper about a year ago, but it was a well-designed little app. I really dug the typography, and it&rsquo;s syncing engine was fast and <a href="http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary">superbly thought out</a>. Somewhat bizarrely, Vesper&rsquo;s launch even got a decent amount of coverage from Microsoft, since the syncing engine <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Windows-Azure/Learn-how-Vesper-built-offline-sync-using-Azure-Mobile-Services-">was built on Azure&rsquo;s cloud service</a>.</p>
<p>Vesper&rsquo;s development <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/29/omni">came to a halt after Mr. Simmons departed for the Omni Group</a>. Mr. Simmons was never replaced, and future releases, including <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/native-support-for-ipad-and-landscape/">planned Vesper for Mac</a>, were assumedly shelved. So it goes.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Per Mr. Gruber, there should be a <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/767460811069530113">full post mortem tomorrow</a>.</p>
