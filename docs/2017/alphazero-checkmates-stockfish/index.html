  	<p>Remember how AlphaGo — Google&rsquo;s Go-playing AI — <a href="https://audacious.blog/2016/alphago-masters-go/">went 5-0 against the reigning,
3-time European Go champion</a>? Well, Google&rsquo;s DeepMind team is back with AlphaZero, and it&rsquo;s just crushed the game of chess. Mike Klein, writing for the Chess.com company blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A little more than a year after AlphaGo sensationally won against the top Go player, the artificial-intelligence program AlphaZero has obliterated the <a href="http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/">highest-rated chess engine</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Stockfish, which for most top players is their go-to preparation tool, and which won the 2016 TCEC Championship and the <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/stockfish-wins-chess-com-computer-championship">2017 Chess.com Computer Chess Championship</a>, didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. AlphaZero won the closed-door, 100-game match with 28 wins, 72 draws, and zero losses.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and it took AlphaZero only four hours to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; chess. Sorry humans, you had a good run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take a minute to notice what&rsquo;s interesting about this narrative. It&rsquo;s not that a computer defeated a human, like with AlphaGo, it&rsquo;s that one computer defeated another computer. At what point will it be more entertaining to watch two AIs compete instead of two humans? While you&rsquo;re chewing on that future scenario, let me point out why AlphaZero&rsquo;s accomplishment is being seen as more impressive than AlphaGo&rsquo;s, despite Go being significantly more complex than chess.</p>
<p>With AlphaGo, Google&rsquo;s researches, &ldquo;trained the policy network on 30 million moves from games played by human experts&rdquo;; essentially, &ldquo;watch how the best do it, and use that information to choose your moves&rdquo;. However, AlphaZero wasn&rsquo;t trained on some huge dataset of chess matches. In fact, AlphaZero wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;trained&rdquo; at all. Back to Mr. Klein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would be akin to a robot being given access to thousands of metal bits and parts, but no knowledge of a combustion engine, then it experiments numerous times with every combination possible until it builds a Ferrari.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least we still have physical sports. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/atlas-robot-does-backflips-now/">For now</a>.</p>
