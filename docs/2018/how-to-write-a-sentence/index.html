  	<p>Author Joe Moran had quite a long-winded piece in <em>The Guardian</em> about writing, but this bit is worth saving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet &ndash; a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader&rsquo;s head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don&rsquo;t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds. They look straight past the words into the meaning that they have strong-armed into them. They fasten on content and forget about form &ndash; forgetting that content and form are the same thing, that what a sentence says is the same as how it says it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for excellent technical writing (see my style guide), but most of the writings I consider <em>great</em> have an almost lyrical quality to them.</p>
