In less than three years, Klopp has become the exuberant, <a href="https://twitter.com/LFC/status/1014522254724599808">backslapping and hugging</a> face of the club. His aggressive <a href="https://spielverlagerung.com/2014/10/07/counter-or-gegenpressing/">gegenpressing, or counterpressing</a>, system is the key to Liverpool&rsquo;s ruthless attack, and it can be a pleasure to watch &mdash; provided you&rsquo;re not supporting the team being subjected to it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Klopp&rsquo;s enthusiasm during matches is absolutely intoxicating.</p>
