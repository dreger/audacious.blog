<blockquote>
<p>Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales&rsquo; digital media company, the WikiTribune, is shifting its focus away from traditional news-gathering and moving to a &ldquo;community oriented&rdquo; strategy that prioritizes working with contributors. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the process, the company has laid off its 12 original editorial staffers, <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/10/22/wikitribune-restructures-around-community-following-editorial-exodus">reports The Drum</a>, following the April departure of CNN and Reuters journalist Peter Bale, who initially assembled the team. The WikiTribune began in August of last year, and Wales and his co-founder Orit Kopel <a href="https://www.wikitribune.com/project/what-we-have-learned-so-far/">posted a note to the site earlier this week</a> first mentioning the &ldquo;major personnel changes&rdquo; and the reframing of its focus on the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original idea was to have professional journalists working side-by-side with the community to create an &lsquo;evidence-based&rsquo; news site. Without the editorial staff, how is WikiTribune any different from Wikipedia&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events">portal for current events</a> or <a href="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikinews</a>?</p>
