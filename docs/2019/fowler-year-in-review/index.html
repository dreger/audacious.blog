  	<p>A wonderful writeup from one of my favorite editors. I particularly enjoyed this bit on the craft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This year was transformative for me as far as my writing skills are concerned. I got to the point where I can now sit down and knock out 3000-5000 <em>good</em> words in one sitting, even when completely exhausted at the end of a long workday. My day job as an editor made all the difference here: since I’m so used to thinking of writing and editing as work, I no longer get writer’s block and writing has lost most of its mythical quality (which is a good thing, as far as I’m concerned). In addition to finishing my memoir, I also wrote a couple of pieces for the Times, two novels (which I am currently revising), and one very joyful screenplay.</p>
