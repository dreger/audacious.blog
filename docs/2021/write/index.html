  	<p>Writing is hard. It takes time. And a lot of that time is spent rewriting what you&rsquo;ve already written.</p>
<p>But good writing is easier to pull off than most people think. I think most people are only a few small changes away from being better writers.</p>
<p>My advice? Write sentences, not too many, mostly active.</p>
<h2 id="write-sentences">Write sentences</h2>
<p>The only way to beat a blank page is to fill it. Write a single sentence. Then another. Each sentence should stand on its own. If a sentence tries to say two things, make it two sentences.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t edit yet. Step one is to get words out of your brain and into the world. Besides, you can&rsquo;t rewrite nothing.</p>
<h2 id="not-too-many">Not too many</h2>
<p>Everyone skims. Most writing has too much writing. There&rsquo;s fluff everywhere.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if every sentence is helping move the reader along. If a sentence fails the test, remove it.</p>
<h2 id="mostly-active">Mostly active</h2>
<p>What is an active sentence? Let me show you:</p>
<p>Active voice: I&rsquo;m writing a blog post.</p>
<p>Passive voice: A blog post is being written.</p>
<p>In an active sentence, the subject does the verb. In a passive sentence, the verb is done to the subject.</p>
<p>Active sentences have momentum. They gently push the reader through your words. Passive sentences aren&rsquo;t awful. Many wonderful writers use them. But an active voice is the better default.</p>
<h2 id="write">Write</h2>
<p>Above all else, write! Writing is a learned skill. It can be improved with practice. Put sentences on the page, remove the unnecessary ones, and favor an active voice. Do this repeatedly, and you&rsquo;ll end up a better writer.</p>
<p>Well, most of the time.</p>
