  	<p>After &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo; hit theaters, my imaginary, book-based version of Severus Snape was replaced with Alan Rickman. As I read, and reread, my way through <em>Harry Potter</em>, I remember Snape&rsquo;s dialogue taking on Rickman&rsquo;s permeating, apathetic tone. For me, Rickman made the books better.</p>
<p>Many people <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/obituaries/alan-rickman-dies-at-69.html">will remember Rickman</a> for his role in <em>Die Hard</em> or his stage performances, but I, and I suspect many of my peers, will remember him as one of the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/cartoons/daily-cartoon/bonus-daily-cartoon-remembering-alan-rickman">best damn antagonists</a>&rdquo; our generation could ask for.</p>
