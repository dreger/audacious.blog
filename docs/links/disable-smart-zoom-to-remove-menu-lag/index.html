    <h2><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/9e01ia/til_disabling_smart_zoom_doubletap_with_two/'>MacOS Tip: Disable Smart Zoom to Remove Menu Delay When Clicking or Tapping With Two Fingers</a></h2>
    


    

  	<p>When you perform a right-click in MacOS via the trackpad — by clicking or tapping with two fingers — there&rsquo;s a small delay before you see the contextual menu appear. Apparently, to my delight, this lag <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/9e01ia/til_disabling_smart_zoom_doubletap_with_two/">can be removed</a> by disabling the &ldquo;Smart zoom&rdquo; gesture, relieving MacOS from waiting a few milliseconds to see if another two-finger tap/click was on the way, which would indicate you wanted to zoom the current content.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I never use this zoom feature (pinch-to-zoom is more precise anyhow), and I was able to disable the gesture by going to:</p>
<p><code>System Preferences &gt; Trackpad &gt; Scroll &amp; Zoom</code></p>
<p>and then unchecking &ldquo;Smart zoom&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s amazing how much faster my secondary click feels now — the contextual menu appears instantly. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the small things.</p>
