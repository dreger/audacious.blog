  	<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15250832/facebook-journalism-certification-class-poynter">Natt Garun</a>, the <em>Verge</em>:</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back: this is not a Facebook guide to how to be a journalist. It’s the Facebook guide to how to use Facebook. There were no questions about journalistic integrity, such as verifying your sources, fact-checking, or how to develop your interview skills. Instead, the final assessment questions ranged from technical (“Why might a journalist tag the location of a Facebook Live video broadcast?”) to random trivia about whether you can name that Facebook feature (“Which of these tools lets journalists show their audience a scene from all angles?”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can see the value of teaching journalists how to use Facebook. <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/">62% of adults get their news from social media</a>, and Facebook owns a large slice of that pie. The press <em>should</em> understand the more nuanced parts of such a powerful platform.</p>
<p>That said, this &ldquo;journalism certification&rdquo; is a mislabled joke of a program. Journalists don&rsquo;t need to get more serious about Facebook, Facebook needs to get more serious about journalism.</p>
