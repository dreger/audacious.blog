<p>Mr. Padnick&rsquo;s take is different than the one I came away with post-reading, but I really enjoyed his analysis. Considering our current damp and dark October, and the fact <a href="http://a.co/hj8AxEe">there&rsquo;s a Kindle version for just $1.99</a>, it might be time to revisit Stevenson&rsquo;s classic.</p>
