  	<p>The Medium Exodus of 2018 continues. This week, it&rsquo;s a tweet from CTO and co-founder of Basecamp, David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH):</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <em>Signal v. Noise</em>, it&rsquo;s a well-known &ldquo;publication about the web&rdquo; with almost <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/popular">20 years of history</a>. I&rsquo;ve been reading <em>Signal v. Noise</em> for over a decade now, and their strong opinions on product, design, and business tend to be succinct and influential in those communities.</p>
<p>I was always a bit surprised that Basecamp — staunchly in support of companies that <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-we-choose-profit-e511efc4dcb9">choose profit over potential growth</a> — would go all-in with a platform like Medium. A VC-funded, zero profit publishing company that restricts your ability to control the design of your content felt like the antithesis to what <em>Signal v. Noise</em> was all about. I&rsquo;m not sure where they&rsquo;ll go next (their previous blog was a homegrown Rails app), but if they&rsquo;re not going back to something in-house I could see them trying out <a href="https://ghost.org">Ghost</a>; the 2.0 release <a href="https://blog.ghost.org/2-0/">looks slick</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, this isn&rsquo;t a great sign for Medium. Ever since they <a href="https://audacious.blog/links/medium-kills-off-custom-domains/">dropped support for custom domains</a>, I don&rsquo;t see why any new publications would seriously consider moving there. And if you already have a custom domain with Medium, I&rsquo;d urge you to start looking at alternatives.</p>
<p>I should really just put that in my site&rsquo;s header.</p>
