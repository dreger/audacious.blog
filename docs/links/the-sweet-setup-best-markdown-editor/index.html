  	<p>Over at the <em>Sweet Setup</em>, I wrote down some brief thoughts on a few of the best Markdown editors for iOS. My pick — for most people — is the excellent <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/our-favorite-markdown-writing-app-for-the-iphone/">iA Writer</a>, which has been a staple of my writing kit for years. This was a fun piece to work on, and I think it turned out well.</p>
