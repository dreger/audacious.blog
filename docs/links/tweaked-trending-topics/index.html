  	<p>Laura Sydell, <em>NPR</em>, reporting on Facebook’s recent change to its Trending topics algorithm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of Wednesday, the company has once again changed its trending algorithms. Personal preferences are now out of the equation. &ldquo;Facebook will no longer be personalized based on someone&rsquo;s interests,&rdquo; Facebook says in a press release. &ldquo;Everyone in the same region will see the same topics.&rdquo; For now, a region is considered a country, so everyone in the U.S. should see the same topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how individualized Facebook attempts to make its products, this is a huge pivot for Trending topics. Although region-based topics are the big story here, the Trending section will also now display the original headline and originating source for every story. Good stuff.</p>
