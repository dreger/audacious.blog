		<h2><a title="Masthead" href="https://audacious.blog/masthead/">Masthead</a></h2>
		Audacious is written, edited, and produced by K.Q. Dreger. Published from Northeast Ohio. Thanks for reading. ✌️
(Also, “Kyle” is fine—I just sign my name KQ. My favorite authors all went by first-initial-middle-initial-last-name, and I really like that style.)Get in touch @Dreger or blog@dreger.me.
Your host, briefly K.Q. Dreger is a scrawny, Ohio-raised farm boy who fell in love with his first computer way too early and spent subsequent years learning how it worked.
