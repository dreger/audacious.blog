<blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t take a political scientist to see that the world is on edge. And technology, we often forget, undergirds this political reality. The Internet and innovation have made cultures around the globe collide with historically unprecedented force. With the exception of perhaps a handful of rogue states, like North Korea, we all now eat at the same McDonald’s, use the same iPhones and discuss the same hot-button topics on the same social networks. Every corporation on the planet can do this thanks to—not in large part, but in all parts—technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a cyber World War either dismissed or sensationalized, but I think Mr. Bilton does a good job at providing a realistic view of what future warfare could (will) look like. Interesting read.</p>
