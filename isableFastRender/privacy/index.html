<p>I do not run any third-party advertisements.</p>
<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>
<p>I use an analytics service called <a href="https://clicky.com">Clicky</a> to review how many people have visited, where they might be coming from, and what types of devices they could be using. As of June 2018, I&rsquo;m looking to migrate off of Clicky and on to a service that allows for better anonymization of the data they collect. Truly, the only reason I want to know about my visitors at all is to help me understand (a) where <em>Audacious Fox</em> might be getting linked to from and (b) what sort of devices I need to consider when making design changes. I don&rsquo;t care about most of the other data, and — as mentioned above — I&rsquo;m actively looking to move to a less accurate service.</p>
